### Codebook for Summarizing Data on Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones

The variables in the table produced by the script are

    [1] "activity"  - activity performed (eg. walking, sitting)
    [2] "subject"   - number of the test subject (1-30)      
    [3] - [88]	    - averages of signal data feature estimates
                      (averages only of means and standard deviations)

In tidying the data, only minor changes have been made to the labelling to retain as much information as possible from the original data and experiment setup.

### Change1: Activity labels
Activity labels [1] have been made more concise and readable. 

    activityid  activity    previously	
            1   walking     WALKING
            2   upstairs    WALKING_UPSTAIRS
            3   downstairs	WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
            4   sitting     SITTING
            5   standing    STANDING
            6   laying      LAYING

### Change2: Variable names
Feature or variable names [3]-[88] have been cleaned of non alphanumerical characters.  

      col  Variable name	    Previously		
      [3]   tBodyAccMeanX       tBodyAcc-mean()-X           
            ...        
      [8]   tBodyAccStdZ        tBodyAcc-std()-Z              
            ...             
      [10]  tGravityAccMeanY	 tGravityAcc-mean()-Y
            ...

### Feature Selection 

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
